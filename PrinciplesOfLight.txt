I'm wary of purely mathematical approaches to color harmony; numbers have no aesthetic sensibilities. That said, since the Hue wheel is divided into 360 degrees, one can build a complementary color scheme by adding 180 to the hue for any given color, a triadic by adding and subtracting 120, and so on.

 

The triadics below were done using simple arithmetic in the H field of the Photoshop color picker, adding 120 to the value each time. Pure RGB above (in reverse sequence, sorry!), and your starter color, #509cc0 in the row below.
